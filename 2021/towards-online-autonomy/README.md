* Ever since: you don't own smartphones:
    - hardware and software obsolescence
    - tailored towards consumption and guided interactions, not a tool for creation
    - for majority of users: interactions generate more revenue/profit for other entities than for its users
    - Same is increasingly applying to computers: https://sneak.berlin/20201112/your-computer-isnt-yours/
* 2019-2020: I barely get value out of Twitter anymore, want to migrate away from it
    -> Only benefit: sometimes interesting tech news / trivia
* 2020: Google changing Gmail TaC: no more unlimited free photo storage
    ->


## Progress

* Mid 2020: claim oliz.io domain, use https://mailbox.org with own domain
* Still not fully migrated away from Gmail address
* GitHub still central hosting infrastructure, but since everything is in Git and static: could migrate to anything else pretty easy
* https://github.com/ooz/lego/ should be migrated to something more image focussed (gallery mode for ggpy?)
