title: My Interview Checklist
description: Questions for potential employers and resources to interview teams.
---

Heavily inspired by and copied from [Julia Evans' "Questions I'm asking in interviews"](https://jvns.ca/blog/2013/12/30/questions-im-asking-in-interviews/).

WIP:

## Research

Could be answered by up-front investigation:

* How does the company make money?
* Does the business model scale?
* Ethics?

## Questions

Questions to ask ordered by stage (when to ask in the interviewing process) and topic.

* How is the interview process structured?

### Organization, management, culture

* How does the on-boarding process look like?
* How does internal communication work? Tools? Hierarchies? No-gos?
* How are (technical / architectural) decisions made?
* Are the company revenue, profit and cost structure transparent for employees?
* What is your turnover rate (devs hired-to-lost-ratio last/this year?)
* Is it possible to move to other locations of the company?
* How many hours does senior management work per week (CEO/CTO)?

* Do you think there is any company benefit that is over-the-top, unfair or a waste of money?
* What do you think is the biggest problem in the team/department/company right now? How do you address it?

### Career, community

* How is performance evaluated?
* Can you give me an example of someone whoâ€™s been in a technical role at your company for a long time, and how their responsibilities and role have changed?
* Do you contribute to open source projects (project names, which teams)?
* Do you encourage employees to speak at conferences/universities? How are they supported? Could you name the last talk your company supported (speaker/topic/event)?
* What is the education budget? Are travel costs to conferences covered? How is money/time needed for education balanced?
* How do you address plateauing and mental health?

### Development, team

Adapted [Joel Test](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/), less binary, more Julia questions. Let's call it "Joel & Julia Test" (or "JJ Test"):

* Which version control system do you use?
* Do new candidates write code during their interview?
* How do you track bugs, tasks?
* Can you make a build in one step? Test environment in one step?
* Do you make daily builds?
* How does your deployment process look like?
* Do you fix bugs before writing new code?
* May I see some of the code the team has written?
* Do programmers have quiet working conditions?
* Do you use the best tools money can buy?
* Do you have testers, designers, tech writers?
* Do you do hallway usability testing?
* How is your roadmap determined?

### Other

* When and why did you join this company?
* Flexi-time?
* I need one day in home office on short notice. Who needs to approve this?
* Number of vacation days? If unlimited: how many are taken on average? Is unpaid vacation/sabbatical possible?
* Average number of work hours per week? What are the peaks?
* On call duty? How often? Work on weekends? Special benefits?
* Am I required to travel for this position? How often?
* Do people "login" during vacation? How often?
* How often do you offer above the requested salary? May I speak with someone who got such an offer?

## While on-site

* Observe office space layout/organization
* Observe developer desks. Multiple screens? What is the dominant non-Mac computer brand?
* Check bathroom. Any shortage of soap/paper towels towards the end of the year?
* Could the outside smoking area affect the office climate?
* Water dispenser, kitchen?

## Questions for potential team mates

(Could be one prepared A4 printout per person)

* First name? Position/role/task in team? Time with the company?
* What program windows do you have open on your PC right now?
* Which one is correct and why: 1. Compress, then encrypt or 2. encrypt, then compress?
* In computing, what is a *signature*? What properties does it have? What is the use-case?
* Open-ended coding task asking "how would you improve this piece of code?" Watch out for data structure usage (set/list test), whether they would mention tests, naming
