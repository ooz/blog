title: My Interview Checklist
description: Questions for potential employers and resources to interview teams.
---

Heavily inspired by [Julia Evans' "Questions I'm asking in interviews"](https://jvns.ca/blog/2013/12/30/questions-im-asking-in-interviews/).

WIP:

* Check "Engineering practices"
* Check "Management style"
* all other of Julia's sections are already covered here!

Further: Flesh out a one A4-sheet assignment for future team mates

## Research

Could be answered by up-front investigation (or asking later):

* How does the company make money? Does the business model scale?

## Questions

Questions to ask ordered by stage (when to ask in the interviewing process) and topic.

* How is the interview process structured?

### Organization, management, culture

* How does the onboarding process look like?
* How does internal communication work? Tools? Hierarchies? No-gos?
* Are the company revenue, profit and cost structure transparent for employees?
* What is your turnover rate (devs hired-to-lost-ratio last/this year?)
* Is it possible to move to other locations of the company?
* How many hours does senior management work per week (CEO/CTO)?

* Do you think there is any company benefit that is over-the-top, unfair or a waste of money?
*
* What do you think is the biggest problem in the team/department/company right now? How do you address it?

### Career, community

* Do you contribute to open source projects (project names, which teams)?
* Do you encourage employees to speak at conferences/universities? How are they supported? Could you name the last talk your company supported (speaker/topic/event)?
* What is the education budget? Are travel costs to conferences covered? How is money/time needed for education balanced?
* How do you address plateauing and mental health?
* What else is there?

### Development, team

* How do you manage tasks/knowledge?
* When was the last time you worked long hours? How often does that happen?

### Other

* Flexi-time?
* I need one day in home office on short notice. Who needs to approve this?
* Number of vacation days? If unlimited: how many are taken on average? Is unpaid vacation/sabbatical possible?
* Average number of work hours per week? What are the peaks?
* On call duty? How often? Work on weekends? Special benefits?
* Am I required to travel for this position? How often?
* Do people "login" during vacation? How often?

* How often do you offer above the requested salary? May I speak with someone who got such an offer?
* When and why did you join this company?

## While on-site

* Observe office space layout/organization
* Check bathroom. Any shortage of soap/paper towels towards the end of the year?
* Could the outside smoking area affect the office climate?
* Water dispenser, kitchen?

## Task for potential team mates

* First name? Position/role/task in team? Time with the company?
* What program windows do you have open on your PC right now? Or: If you would need to develop yourself off a remote island without internet access - which programs/software would you bring?
* Which one is correct and why: 1. Compress, then encrypt or 2. encrypt, then compress?
* In computing, what is a *signature*? What properties does it have? What is the use-case?
* Open-ended coding task asking "how would you improve this piece of code?" Watch out for data structure usage (set/list test), whether they would mention tests, naming
