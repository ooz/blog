[Celeste Headlee](https://www.ted.com/talks/celeste_headlee_10_ways_to_have_a_better_conversation):

**Listen!**

Forget what you have heard!

1. Don't multitask!
2. Don't pontificate! (express one's opinions in a way considered annoyingly pompous and dogmatic)
   Assume that you have something to learn
3. Use open ended questions!
4. Go with the flow!
5. If you don't know, say that you don't know!
6. Don't equate your experience with their's!
7. Try not to repeat yourself!
8. Forget the details!
9. Listen!
10. Be brief!

**Always be prepared to be amazed!**
