I am Oliver and this is my personal blog about:

1. **Time** <br />
    Well, it is part of the name. Also it is the only resource there is and where are chronically out of it.
2. **Life** <br />
    Tied closely to 1.
3. **Design** <br />
    What I like, what I dislike, what I learned. This will probably involve some Lego.
4. **Technology and Software Engineering** <br />
    That is what I do for a living.
5. **Zen** <br />
    Starts with Z, too. So that is basically my second name.

This post will serve me as a reference, so expect to see weird things below this line:

Various `inline` *highlighting* **works** ~~too~~!
