Despite all the negative effects of Corona, I prefer to appreciate the novel experiences.

## Corona Skies

![Corona Sky](corona-sky.jpg)

The European airspace is one of the most utilized on earth.
Thus it is rare to look up the sky and not see any condensation trails.

Now, living in a city with a nearby airport, we have *Corona skies*, which I would define as:

> The natural sky either clouded or cloudless without any signs of human flight.

Eventually, an increase in condensation trails may be a good metric on how much we are going "back to normal".

## Dystopian Malls

Whenever getting supplies, there are recorded public announcements playing.
The content always boils down to:

1. Mind the *government Corona laws*
2. Stay *safe and healthy*
3. Enjoy and *keep shopping*

*EL-OH-EL!*

## Digitization on Warp Speed

I was slightly ahead of the curve by working remotely in a distributed team, having read relevant literature before and ac. Due to the Corona situation, our company and team adapted quickly to full-remote and without problems.

There are studies on how much the Corona situation sped up digitization. Here's an example from our household:

* Ordering clothes online, mostly at [uniqlo](https://www.uniqlo.com/de/de/home).
* Ordering toiletries, cleaning utensils etc. [online](https://www.dm.de/). Yes, they ship even soft, pleasant, scarce, super valuable toilet paper -- for pennies! WHO is the idiot here?!
* Ordering organic vegetables, fruit and meat from a local farmer, online

## The Soundtrack

Update 2022-03-11: all songs are also very suitable for staying sane in war propaganda times.

German:

* Die Ärzte, "Ein Lied für Jetzt": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_s6waEUTbI (melancholic, sarcastic)
* Die Bergers, positive and uplifting cover of the above: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o762F5XaIU0 (thanks, YT algorithm for promoting this gem!)
* Die Ärzte, "Regierung": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REgzERt81zM

English:

* Twisted Sister, "We're Not Gonna Take It": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xmckWVPRaI
* RHCP, "Throw Away Your Television", "Can't Stop": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxl2iqtEWvQ, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DyziWtkfBw

## Update 2022-03-06: Lingua Coronae

In reference to [Victor Klemperer's LTI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTI_%E2%80%93_Lingua_Tertii_Imperii), gathering primarily from the German media:

* Speaker announcements "Helden an der Front" (meaning "heroic front line" workers like supermarket employees, farmers, medical personell. Wartime propaganda language)
* coronapositiv, "mit Coronavirus infiziert", anstecken, infizieren (invoking language with majority association to HIV)
* social distancing (taken over from English, similar but different to "public viewing", which isn't an actual English concept. Signals some kind of internationally accepted standard)
* Coronaleugner, Coronaverharmloser (invoking language with exclusive association to the Holocaust and anti-human views. Exclusivity was first broken for climate change: "Klimaleugner")
* Lockdown, Shutdown (previously primarily used in prison/military context)
* Concern for public health (Nazis would have called it "Volksgesundheit", trying to make individual/private health decisions a matter of public concern, shaming/blaming, claiming higher morals)
* Einschränkungen (restrictions, euphemism for gross loss/forfeiture/revocation of basic civil liberties, destruction of small-/medium-sized businesses)
* Impfung, Inzidenz (re-use of existing words with new, slightly altered meaning, not publishing number of tests, not marking/controlling for significant changes in pandemic response)
* Impfgegner (enemy metaphor, wartime propaganda language), Impfstützpunkt (as in "military base", again militaristic language)
* 3G, 3G+, 2G, 2G+, 1G, -Regel (scientism, buzzwords, variation of those rules have no scientific merit besides pushing people to get vaccinated. As benefit, inconveniences imposed by those rules may be temporarily skipped)
* Schwurbler (discrediting opposing arguments and people voicing them as idiots, mentally ill)
* Sicher und effektiv (safe and effective, with various degrees), "trust the science!" (good science doesn't need trust, it is self-evident and accessible to at least any academic. Flying to the moon requires a leap of faith in all the science, engineering and people involved. Experimental drugs do, too!)
* Alltagsmaske, medizinische Maske, FFP2 mask, Maskenpflicht (salami slice tactic of conditioning population to masks, starting with near-useless ones, moving up to proper masks. Guaranteed sales due to amigo politics)
* Coronawarnapp, Coronaapp, Coronapass, Coronapasspflicht (salami slice tactic, pushing acceptance of digital means of identification, normalization to "check-in". Implementing technocratic "computer said no", offloading responsibility from politics to technocratic system)
* "Politisches Versprechen" (political promise, as in: a promise which will be broken for sure, e.g. "no wall", "no road charges", "no additional lockdown")
* "For freedom!" (through the opposite means of lockdown, technocratic testing and coerced vaccination)
* News reports suggesting to peach, spy on neighbors during lockdowns
* News reports of married couples having arguments of vaccine decision, holiday advice on how to deal with relatives having different views
* Geimpft, genesen oder gestorben (both German president and health minister echoed this triplet of "vaccinated, recovered or dead". Aimed to push people to get vaccinated, although a tautology: after more than two years of pandemic, most people are probably recovered without even knowing [if they didn't get vaccinated])
