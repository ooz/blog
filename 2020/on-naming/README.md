tags: draft

* Reference two hard things: https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html
* R. Martin: Clean Code, entire chapter 2 on "Meaningful Names"
* Minified JavaScript is not human-readable, thus not understandable and non-free: https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html

## Examples

* Dead verbs
* Generic nouns
* `result`
* add, remove (git messages)
