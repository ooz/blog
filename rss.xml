      <title>Personal Contacts CRM INI File</title>
      <link>https://oliz.io/blog/2022/personal-crm.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 27 Feb 2022 23:33:38 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://oliz.io/blog/2022/personal-crm.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wow, even without a clickbait, SEO-optimized &lt;em&gt;"How-to ..."&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;"X Reasons ..."&lt;/em&gt; prefix, the post title sounds like a heap of bullshit! ðŸ˜…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, my biggest pain point &lt;a href="https://oliz.io/blog/2021/towards-online-autonomy/"&gt;migrating away from "big tech"&lt;/a&gt; was my contacts list neatly synchronized by Google.
In the last year, I missed quite some birthdays, address updates and have generally been "minimal-social" due to lack of proper bookkeeping!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="history-and-requirements"&gt;History and Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already made it a habit to note key learnings after interactions with people I don't meet regularly.
When companies do this, it's called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management"&gt;Customer Relationship Management (CRM)&lt;/a&gt;, so the ever rotating clerks know of your correspondence.
This may sound &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stasi#Recovery_of_Stasi_files"&gt;creepy&lt;/a&gt;, but has the benefit of being more considerate and respectful with each other's time.
No more &lt;em&gt;"I thought, I already told you"&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;"What was the name of your child again?"&lt;/em&gt;
That "database" was a set of local text files and I wanted to combine it with the contacts list exported from Google (&lt;code&gt;.csv&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Human- and machine-readable, plaintext, easy to edit and process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support structured master data like name, birthday, email, phone, address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support optional, arbitrary fields&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support timestamped list of events, meaning what interaction happened with that person on a specific day, key insights gained&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All data in a single file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Store master file/backups in KeePass, have a local copy for scripts to access&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="solution-and-format"&gt;Solution and Format&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I settled for an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file"&gt;INI file&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html"&gt;Python has built-in support&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt;ing works, too.
Each person gets a section.
Master data are key-value pairs, notable events are date-note pairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;[FirstName_LastName]
bday = 1990-09-29
email = foobar@example.com
address = Foo St. 23, 01234 City
2020-06-22 = Met for lunch, recently switched to ABCorp, children are well
2021-09-29 = Birthday telephone call, vegan for 6 months

[FirstName_?]
phone = +49 123456789
info = Met at festival

[unsorted]
Alice = XYZ user group meetup 2022-02-02, new to City and topic
John = XYZ user group meetup 2022-02-02, did Karate (6th Kyu) in school&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keys for unknown values may be omitted, unknown values in structured data may be masked with &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; characters (e.g. unknown birth year may become &lt;code&gt;????&lt;/code&gt;).
This has the benefit of easy parsing/&lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt;ing.
I made a little &lt;a href="https://github.com/ooz/olli/blob/master/.scripts/birthdays.py"&gt;script&lt;/a&gt; which reads all birthdays (if present), sorts them by month and day, and prints the entire list with a "today" marker.
For me, this is a good-enough substitute for Google Calendar birthday notifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="next-steps"&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, I keep the INI file locally and back it up to KeePass.
More automated encryption and synchronization would be nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But first, I still need to migrate a good chunk of contacts data. ðŸ™‚&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>DIY Bungee Cord Pullup Bar Bicycle Lift</title>
      <link>https://oliz.io/blog/2022/diy-bingo/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 10 Mar 2022 21:28:47 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://oliz.io/blog/2022/diy-bingo/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Originally, I wanted to write on something else, but I'm taking the opportunity to continue my AI-generated, bullshit bingo post title streak. Documenting my engineering feats for future personal reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="problem-and-idea"&gt;Problem and Idea&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, someone placed (lost?) nail(s?) on a bicycle lane.
I was lucky enough to need to replace both inner tube and wheel mantle...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reassembling the rear wheel, I probably didn't tighten the nuts enough,
so the rear axle continuously pushed further into the frame due to road bumps o.s. (see upper sketch).
Resulting in the chain losing tension and jumping of the cogs all the time (to the point, the bicycle basically can't be used).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Problem sketch" src="sketch.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Black: frame, blue: chain/pedal axle, red/dark green: rear axle)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My idea was to lift the bike, loosen the nuts, so gravity pulls the rear wheel down till the chain has proper tension (lower image, I failed at drawing the chain properly, imagine it "tighter"). Then &lt;em&gt;thoroughly&lt;/em&gt; tighten the nuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are special "tripods" for bicycles to lift and maintain them.
Since I have none and don't intend to get one, I DIY'd it.
Alternatives include going to a self-service bike workshop, pay a small fee and use the equipment there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="behold-der-gerat"&gt;Behold, &lt;em&gt;der GerÃ¤t&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pullup bar + bungee cord + steel cable" src="geraet0.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="Full view, except pullup bar" src="geraet1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Routing the steel cable around the saddle resulted in a upright position already, spirit level can be used to check)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Closer view at rear wheel" src="geraet2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Box of recently bought shoes protecting carpeting)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MacGyver score: &lt;strong&gt;5 out of 10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Major league rubber band used&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oil spill prevented, carpeting unharmed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swiss Army Knife was in reach, but not needed since proper tools were available&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No evil guys bicycle sabotage conspiracy uncovered&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <title>Feedback Friday</title>
      <link>https://oliz.io/blog/2022/feedback-friday.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 11 Mar 2022 23:36:38 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://oliz.io/blog/2022/feedback-friday.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Twitter has the concept of "Follow Friday":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each Friday, remind yourself to follow a new person&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This appreciates the work of others, may extend your bubble and their reach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Twitter and its users, this has the following effects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users get Dopamine kicks from gaining followers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users engage more in the platform (spend more time there) by both posting more content and consuming more content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="better-way"&gt;Better Way&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little reminder, this stuff was already possible is still possible with "web 1.0": via websites and emails, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, I propose "Feedback Friday":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each Friday, reach out to someone whose work you appreciate, who inspired you. Maybe give pointers if asked for&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the preferred channel of the person you are contacting (email?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe only do so if they explicitly asked for it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;...or you see, they could use a cheer-up!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ping"&gt;Ping!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the last two weeks, I got appreciative emails from &lt;a href="https://jonathanwieben.com/"&gt;jonathanwieben.com&lt;/a&gt; (a former colleague) and &lt;a href="https://ohio.araw.xyz/"&gt;ohio.araw.xyz&lt;/a&gt; (someone from nearly the opposite of the planet, who has common interests). Thanks all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both motivated the heck out of me, to write more and get back to work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="action"&gt;Action!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk is cheap, so the last two weeks...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="task-list"&gt;
&lt;li class="task-list-item"&gt;&lt;input type="checkbox" disabled checked/&gt; Sent a mail to Joshua (&lt;a href="https://falseknees.com/"&gt;https://falseknees.com/&lt;/a&gt;) pointing out that we implemented &lt;a href="https://falseknees.com/111.html"&gt;one of his comics&lt;/a&gt; by accident with &lt;a href="https://oliz.io/handshake/"&gt;Handshake game&lt;/a&gt;. Checking and recognizing later comics, I noticed he's a quite famous person now. Not expecting a reply, the subject may have also been too "spammy". But I hope, if read, it puts a smile on his face!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="task-list-item"&gt;&lt;input type="checkbox" disabled checked/&gt; Sent a ping to Melissa (&lt;a href="https://gracefully-unsettled.com/"&gt;https://gracefully-unsettled.com/&lt;/a&gt;, former colleague), who hasn't posted an update in a while, asking whether she's fine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go go!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Corona Sky</title>
      <link>https://oliz.io/blog/2020/corona-sky/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 23 Aug 2020 15:10:25 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://oliz.io/blog/2020/corona-sky/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite all the negative effects of Corona, I prefer to appreciate the novel experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="corona-skies"&gt;Corona Skies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Corona Sky" src="corona-sky.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European airspace is one of the most utilized on earth.
Thus it is rare to look up the sky and not see any condensation trails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, living in a city with a nearby airport, we have &lt;em&gt;Corona skies&lt;/em&gt;, which I would define as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The natural sky either clouded or cloudless without any signs of human flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Corona Sky panorama" src="corona-sky_pano.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, an increase in condensation trails may be a good metric on how much we are going "back to normal".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dystopian-malls"&gt;Dystopian Malls&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever getting supplies, there are recorded public announcements playing.
The content always boils down to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mind the &lt;em&gt;government Corona laws&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay &lt;em&gt;safe and healthy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enjoy and &lt;em&gt;keep shopping&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EL-OH-EL!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="digitization-on-warp-speed"&gt;Digitization on Warp Speed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was slightly ahead of the curve by working remotely in a distributed team, having read relevant literature before and ac. Due to the Corona situation, our company and team adapted quickly to full-remote and without problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are studies on how much the Corona situation sped up digitization. Here's an example from our household:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ordering clothes online, mostly at &lt;a href="https://www.uniqlo.com/de/de/home"&gt;uniqlo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ordering toiletries, cleaning utensils etc. &lt;a href="https://www.dm.de/"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, they ship even soft, pleasant, scarce, super valuable toilet paper -- for pennies! WHO is the idiot here?!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ordering organic vegetables, fruit and meat from a local farmer, online&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-soundtrack"&gt;The Soundtrack&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update 2022-03-11: all songs are also very suitable for staying sane in war propaganda times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;German:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Die Ã„rzte, "Ein Lied fÃ¼r Jetzt": &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_s6waEUTbI"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_s6waEUTbI&lt;/a&gt; (melancholic, sarcastic)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Die Bergers, positive and uplifting cover of the above: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o762F5XaIU0"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o762F5XaIU0&lt;/a&gt; (thanks, YT algorithm for promoting this gem!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Die Ã„rzte, "Regierung": &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REgzERt81zM"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REgzERt81zM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;English:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twisted Sister, "We're Not Gonna Take It": &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xmckWVPRaI"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xmckWVPRaI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RHCP, "Throw Away Your Television", "Can't Stop": &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxl2iqtEWvQ"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxl2iqtEWvQ&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DyziWtkfBw"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DyziWtkfBw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="update-2022-03-06-lingua-coronae"&gt;Update 2022-03-06: Lingua Coronae&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reference to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTI_%E2%80%93_Lingua_Tertii_Imperii"&gt;Victor Klemperer's LTI&lt;/a&gt;, gathering primarily from the German media:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaker announcements "Helden an der Front" (meaning "heroic front line" workers like supermarket employees, farmers, medical personell. Wartime propaganda language)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;coronapositiv, "mit Coronavirus infiziert", anstecken, infizieren (invoking language with majority association to HIV)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;social distancing (TODO)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coronaleugner, Coronaverharmloser (invoking language with exclusive association to the Holocaust and anti-human views. Exclusivity was first broken for climate change: "Klimaleugner")&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lockdown, Shutdown (previously primarily used in prison/military context)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Concern for public health (Nazis would have called it "Volksgesundheit", trying to make individual/private health decisions a matter of public concern, shaming/blaming, claiming higher morals)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EinschrÃ¤nkungen (restrictions, euphemism for gross loss/forfeiture/revocation of basic civil liberties, destruction of small-/medium-sized businesses)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impfung, Inzidenz (re-use of existing words with new, slightly altered meaning, not publishing number of tests, not marking/controlling for significant changes in pandemic response)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impfgegner (enemy metaphor, wartime propaganda language), ImpfstÃ¼tzpunkt (as in "military base", again militaristic language)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3G, 3G+, 2G, 2G+, 1G, -Regel (scientism, buzzwords, variation of those rules have no scientific merit besides pushing people to get vaccinated. As benefit, inconveniences imposed by those rules may be temporarily skipped)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Schwurbler (discrediting opposing arguments and people voicing them as idiots, mentally ill)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sicher und effektiv (safe and effective, with various degrees), "trust the science!" (good science doesn't need trust, it is self-evident and accessible to at least any academic. Flying to the moon requires a leap of faith in all the science, engineering and people involved. Experimental drugs do, too!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alltagsmaske, medizinische Maske, FFP2 mask, Maskenpflicht (salami slice tactic of conditioning population to masks, starting with near-useless ones, moving up to proper masks. Guaranteed sales due to amigo politics)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coronawarnapp, Coronaapp, Coronapass, Coronapasspflicht (salami slice tactic, pushing acceptance of digital means of identification, normalization to "check-in". Implementing technocratic "computer said no", offloading responsibility from politics to technocratic system)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Politisches Versprechen" (political promise, as in: a promise which will be broken for sure, e.g. "no wall", "no road charges", "no additional lockdown")&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"For freedom!" (through the opposite means of lockdown, technocratic testing and coerced vaccination)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;News reports suggesting to peach, spy on neighbors during lockdowns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;News reports of married couples having arguments of vaccine decision, holiday advice on how to deal with relatives having different views&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Geimpft, genesen oder gestorben (TODO)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <title>On Mastery</title>
      <link>https://oliz.io/blog/2022/on-mastery.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 13 Mar 2022 21:56:15 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://oliz.io/blog/2022/on-mastery.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No master without students.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is age-old wisdom coming in various iterations and examples.
Here are some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="in-art-eg-paintings-classical-music"&gt;In art (e.g. paintings, classical music)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some great artists were recognized at their time, amassed great fortune and fame, had plenty of contemporary students to teach to and learn from.
Others also did great work, but died alone, poor, without recognition, without any direct students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, you can seemingly fail as a master during your lifetime.
But if you were determined and truly great, you will get redeemed by your future students.
Across time.
Ultimately, the joke is on them: because you aren't around anymore to be asked questions and the students were "too late" to get the cues, they now need to try extra hard to understand! Haha!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="in-martial-arts-japanese-shuhari-and-karate"&gt;In martial arts: Japanese &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuhari"&gt;Shuhari&lt;/a&gt; and Karate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shu ("protect", "obey"): student learns, repeats and practises basics, following the master&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ha ("detach", "digress"): the master student, "master" (1st kyu [highest brown belt], 1st dan [first black belt]) is at the high of their ability and execution, knowing all the relevant stuff and realizing they aren't the first to reach this point. Maybe they challenge the master to include or adapt things with a fresh view. The master student may lead the dojo in the master's absence or on their behalf.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ri ("leave", "separate"): master on the path to true mastery perpetuating their great art. By applying, displaying and teaching. By breaking down and questioning learned forms, movements. Together with new students, both master and students lift the art to "go with the times", "stay current" and thus real.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early Karate in Okinawa was more like a mixed martial art, similar to Chinese Kung Fu ("Karate" literally first meant "Chinese Hand"). Karateka trained all kinds of techniques to overpower and kill (e.g. sweeps, throws, chokes, grappling) playing a lesser role in modern training. Some may have incorporated their available tools and weapons. They trained hard, harming their body in the long term, but this was appropriate because you either trained hard to beat the pirates in a few months or die at the hand of the raiders, never reaching old age anyway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Karate in the military: Karate was used as physical education. Low, wide stances and punches don't make sense in industrialized, armed conflict, but the strengthening, endurance and discipline aspects go long ways also in war. Masters were aware and adapted teachings to circumstances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modern day: Anyone (incl. women, children, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaXU8_soOBQ"&gt;impaired people&lt;/a&gt;) can train this and adapt the forms to their bodily limits and try to reach further. Karate can be trained till old age with great health, motor, cognitive benefits, without ever getting into a real fight. Even if that's just due to anticipation, avoiding fights in the first place instead of physical prowess. The "way of the empty hand" (contemporary reading of "Karate"), so to say.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite, fighting capability and spirit are still very important for further propagation of the art. Masters take this into account and screen for the "warrior heart". Quitters don't win and won't graduate the black belt. Even if they get it while lacking quality, maybe the master's attention slipped and didn't notice the flaw in character. Then they will doubt themselves, see how poor their forms are compared to other black belts, other masters and they will eventually stop wearing the belt, quitting Karate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="in-education-and-academia"&gt;In education and academia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you achieve a "master title" in academia or your "master diploma" as a craftsman (f/m/d),
you have demonstrated that you are at the top of your game, know all the relevant stuff and are ready to be released onto the world without training wheels.
Some of those masters teach students, take apprentices, become doctors, professors. Others may create such great things, that even without taking direct students, future students will study their work for insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="in-mathematics-students-t-distribution"&gt;In mathematics: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-distribution"&gt;Student's t-distribution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this "math master", instead of getting his name attributed to his works (like most of the masters before and after him), he chose to delay credit (it got attributed anyway, check the linked Wikipedia article) and by choosing a considerate pseudonym spread the idea that even a master must be a perpetual student.
Any proper math teacher or professor will explain the name, that the distribution is really called "student" not because a person was named like this, but because the person wanted to highlight that they saw themselves as "eternal math students" and that there always will be something left to study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="in-popular-culture-star-wars"&gt;In popular culture: Star Wars&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mastery is explored extensively in Star Wars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galen Erso (&lt;a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Rogue_One"&gt;Rogue One&lt;/a&gt;) is a master weapon builder, engineer and scientist. He is forced to finish the most powerful weapon ever: the Death Star. Knowing that the evil empire will discard him after, he planned a long-running plot: He built in weak point by design to be found and relayed to the rebels/resistance by his daughter. The rebels then studied it hard and destroyed the Death Star (+ later iterations). Each time with greater ease. They basically achieved "undo evil powerful weapons" mastery, as their master Galen Erso intended with his master work. The incapable evil empire couldn't fix the inherent design flaws, because they weren't masters and also poor students. It took a while, but after the 3rd station got destroyed they got the message and stopped building "just another Death Star"â„¢, but went with a more conservative approach "even bigger fleet". Well, no mastery there either, judging by how it turned out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jedi: A Jedi master may take multiple padawans over the course of his life. A padawan may become a master and teach padawans themselves. Potentially, this ensures greater spread and higher numbers. Some may disagree and may part with the Jedi order to instead become...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sith: Who took mastery to the extreme ("absolutes" so to say, hehe) with the "Rule of Two": At any given time there may be only one Sith Lord with only one Sith Apprentice. To become the lord, the apprentice needs to kill the master. Either by sheer force/power or by great wit/deceit, whatever is more suitable for continuation of the Sith given the circumstances.
The apprentice fails when the lord kills them instead. The master grows more powerful with this, too: Learning how the student tried to outplay, what better qualities to look for in the next apprentice. Darth Sidious had and outgrew multiple apprentices until ultimately killed and both sides of the force merged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you see, the pattern is pretty omnipresent and told in various forms.
To reach as many humans as possible.
I'm sure, you can find further examples!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="on-students"&gt;On Students&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we talked a lot about "masters" and "mastery", but little about students.
That's because there isn't much to say, if you understood it to this point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No such thing as "bad students".&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's also common wisdom and it's self-evident from the very word: &lt;em&gt;studere&lt;/em&gt; is Latin for "to sincerely try".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the only task a student has, is to try. Try to understand the masters and their greatness. Try to outshine them.
They don't necessarily need to succeed. They may fail, that's fine.
They then may look for a different master, a different topic and try again. Others may take their place instead.
The only bad student is a student who doesn't try, in which case they aren't a "student" by the very sense of the word. A student giving up, simply ceases to be a student. Not offending any master, any craft or anything really, but themselves. By wasting their own time. A master claiming in front of poorly performing students that "they are wasting the master's time" isn't reflecting enough on what he could learn from the student's failures. At the same time, the master implicitly asks them to try harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus "bad student" is an inherent oxymoron, while "excellent master" is an obvious tautology.
If we don't think like this, e.g. having the need to distinguish between "masters" and "great masters". Then, maybe, we have watered down the term "master" a bit too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I hope this post corrected the image. Highlighting that obtaining mastery is a perpetual, self-correcting process. Sounds a lot like all of life, huh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="on-mediocrity"&gt;On Mediocrity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens with the masters who aren't good enough and the students who never achieved mastery in anything ever?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mediocrity will simply be forgotten.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the opening sentence of this post could be reworded to:
&lt;em&gt;If your art, craft etc. dies with you, you were a lesser than all the masters before you!&lt;/em&gt;
Even if your trade is still relevant to humankind, new students will simply skip past you to the masters before you! The joke is on you there! Ouch!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="in-architecture-pyramids-and-saint-basils-cathedral"&gt;In architecture: Pyramids and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Basil%27s_Cathedral"&gt;Saint Basil's Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The master builders of the pyramids got buried with their pharaohs.
Did we forgot how to build pyramids? Yes!
Do we know how the pyramids were built? Not quite, but we have some ideas!
Do we really need to build further pyramids? Probably not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did we learn something anyway? Yeah, for instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stone and paintings last long time, even longer than the language that is used to write the hieroglyphs!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Air-tight interlocking sandstone is awesome and very rigid!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Air-tight locked rooms and darkness breed deadly fungus and when opened you get very sick and die&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since the construction is so timeless, maybe important information wasn't encoded in language, but in architecture?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did the pharaohs have a bad intention bury their builders with them?
We don't know! Maybe it doesn't matter, either!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 id="personal-anecdotes"&gt;Personal Anecdotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Form my software engineering life:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I.
I once interviewed an applicant for a (senior) software development position.
Previously, the candidate worked in a consulting firm literally called "senior dev only" specializing in renting out senior developers to needy companies. I wondered, how that'd work and how they'd know that they are all "senior developers". Was it by age (to fight blatant agism, let's mean "years of experience")? Was by the amount of money they charge gullible companies?
The candidate wasn't that good by my judgement, some knowledge at display was outdated. We ended up not hiring the candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;II.
Similarly, some very capable (by my judgement), senior colleagues left for another company.
That company had huge financial backing and was hiring "senior devs only" to finish an ambitious project on a tight one year schedule.
I didn't check back again, but here are my assumptions of possible outcomes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Too many cooks spoil the broth: Each senior dev has their own ideas how things should work, lots of meetings, agreement takes ages. Eventually, the thing is too late and over budget, oops!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most likely, the senior devs realize the situation, evaluate available abilities, preferences and requirements. Naturally, some of them lead and push bigger design decisions. Others step down a bit and follow. In this case, the company could have hired less seniors and more juniors and probably achieved a similar result, cheaper. Oops! Don't tell that the bean counters!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In magical fairytale land, all the seniors devs got along in perfect harmony. They delivered a high quality solution, under budget, on time. After this great achievement, all the great achievers head out to the next challenge (other project, other company). The software works, eventually requirements change, nobody's there anymore to understand the thing and there's limited documentation/onboarding/handover material. What's there can only be understood by great achievers. Eventually, the company hires further great achievers which attest a re-write is needed at great cost. Oops!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;III.
So I was teaching "modern" software engineering for one semester (2020-2021 during pandemic) at university, which is a separate blog post still in the makingÂ©.
The gist is, I worked my way backwards from primary motive of "working software" (duh, surprise!) in the Agile Manifesto.
Close to the end of semester, I got evaluated by the students.
Besides all the benevolent feedback which I received, the most helpful one was (paraphrased):
"Agile is pseudo-scientific mumbojumbo and I wished the lecturer would have instead focussed more on &lt;em&gt;real engineering&lt;/em&gt; instead of personal anecdotes."
Ufff, that hit hard! Quite a revelation!
Even if I may have failed that student, it pushed me to try harder.
I openly motivated my strategy again, so hopefully the rest of them got the message.
Overall, the students tried hard despite the suboptimal Corona situation, did very well in required presentations and the exam.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Writing Executive Summaries</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You know what always helped me acting upon the wisdom I read in BOOKs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Writing summaries, or cheat sheets&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can do so even if you haven't read the entire book, yet!
Then you should just put a version or volume number on it, that you can increment when you gain further noteworthy learnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bible-example"&gt;Bible Example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years I started reading the Bible (New Testament, in GERMAN by MARTIN LUTHER for MAXIMUM AUTHENTICITY). So, please ignore the German words, I'll provide a translation for the summarized ones below the photo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="side-by-side" src="first.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="book-below" src="second.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Please excuse poor image quality, I'm not a good photographer, but I hope you get the IDEA)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Translation of the German words in the summary, so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;learn, read, train
create, write
get rid of, improve
rest, play
invest, sell&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me following those motives AND LOVING MY WOMÃ„N LALA, helped me greatly achieving TRUE GREATNESS and PURE LOVE. Hence I pimped up the empty space with pictures of US:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lala in her BUSINESS SUIT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Olli applying for UNIVERSITY, still with military haircut&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Towards Online Autonomy</title>
      <link>https://oliz.io/blog/2021/towards-online-autonomy/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 06 Jun 2021 21:49:18 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://oliz.io/blog/2021/towards-online-autonomy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Smartphones have become the "personal computer":
a computer in your hand, solving most of your consumer computer use-cases (e.g. communication, (re-)search, navigation, shopping, photo, video, music, social and other media).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since, I'm annoyed, that we don't (can't) really &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; smartphones like we can own other computing equipment.
Smartphones have hard- and software obsolescence built-in.
They are tailored towards consumption and guided interactions, most of the time they are inferior tools for creation.
Users may perceive value from interacting with a smartphone, but the majority of interactions generate more revenue/profit for other entities through &lt;a href="https://oliz.io/blog/2020/dev-talk-binge-random-wisdom/#attention-economy"&gt;attention economy&lt;/a&gt;
(making platforms more attractive for other users, network effects, data classification, entry and generation etc.)
If you don't use your smartphone to make money (media creator, influencer?), you are paying -sometimes premium- for being used and distracted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tech-is-getting-consolidated"&gt;Tech is Getting Consolidated...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This entire development didn't start and won't end with smartphones.
&lt;a href="https://stallman.org/"&gt;RMS&lt;/a&gt; has been anticipating and warning about it for decades already (see his &lt;a href="https://stallman.org/glossary.html#used"&gt;definition of "Useds"&lt;/a&gt;). It's common knowledge by now, some examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hardware backdoors (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Management_Engine"&gt;Intel ME&lt;/a&gt;, undocumented x86 instructions) in mainline processors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://staltz.com/the-web-began-dying-in-2014-heres-how.html"&gt;The internet becoming more centralized&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/top-100-websites-ranking.html"&gt;a dozen of mega corporations owning the majority of the traffic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the near future, &lt;a href="https://sneak.berlin/20201112/your-computer-isnt-yours/"&gt;we'll get smartphone-level surveillance and "ownership" for our other computers, too&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://oliz.io/blog/2021/pegasus-android-check/"&gt;Pegasus anyone?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expiring computers may be fine for most companies leasing or cycling every 2-3 years and some users, who rotate in a similar fashion to "stay on the edge".
In my opinion, sustainable, exhaustive tech usage should be preferred, which is also dependent on &lt;em&gt;user-serviceable&lt;/em&gt;, secure hard- and software.
State and malicious actors may like loopholes, but &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/power-grid-cyberattack-facebook-phone-numbers-security-news/"&gt;insecure infrastructure ultimately harms everyone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general population (not just the nerds) is spending more screentime consuming social media, streaming content and games. Thus we are increasingly exposed to and determined by the above developments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="and-boring"&gt;...and Boring&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting in 2019, I noticed how I barely got any value out of Twitter anymore. Of course, there was the occasional interesting tech news, story or funny pastime, but interacting with it felt like a chore.
So I stopped using it, &lt;a href="https://sneak.berlin/20200211/instagram/"&gt;social media isn't there to connect us anyway&lt;/a&gt;.
I'm still in the process of migrating my content away from the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another wake-up call has been &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/photos/storage-changes/"&gt;Google Photos' changed storage policy&lt;/a&gt;: Unlimited photo storage and sync has been so convenient. Google profited greatly from all the training data! Now that the noise is increasing and the value is diminishing, economics are back to remind us all: "Useds" of a free service don't own anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this sped up my migration away from my previously central &lt;code&gt;gmail.com&lt;/code&gt; address towards my own &lt;code&gt;oliz.io&lt;/code&gt; domain in 2020. I evaluated my exposure to and reliance on "big tech", too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="progress-so-far-to-be-updated-over-time"&gt;Progress so Far (to Be Updated Over Time)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autonomy gained:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="task-list"&gt;
&lt;li class="task-list-item"&gt;&lt;input type="checkbox" disabled checked/&gt; Acquire &lt;code&gt;oliz.io&lt;/code&gt; domain in 2020&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="task-list-item"&gt;&lt;input type="checkbox" disabled checked/&gt; Use &lt;a href="https://mailbox.org"&gt;https://mailbox.org&lt;/a&gt; with own domain for email&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="task-list-item"&gt;&lt;input type="checkbox" disabled checked/&gt; Build static website on &lt;code&gt;oliz.io&lt;/code&gt; domain, using &lt;a href="https://oliz.io/ggpy/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;gg.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="task-list-item"&gt;&lt;input type="checkbox" disabled checked/&gt; &lt;a href="https://oliz.io/blog/2022/personal-crm.html"&gt;Find good, local solution for keeping track of birthdays and contacts&lt;/a&gt;, migrate contacts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stopped/minimized using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="task-list"&gt;
&lt;li class="task-list-item"&gt;&lt;input type="checkbox" disabled checked/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;XING&lt;/strong&gt;: Used its "one year pause" mode which recently expired, it spammed me again and I deleted it permanently.
                Preferring LinkedIn (and considering moving my data out there, too)
                Too much and not valuable recruiter spam made me lock down notification settings and network exposure, &lt;a href="https://blog.calebjay.com/posts/how-to-use-linkedin-as-a-coding-bootcamp-grad/"&gt;but then again I'm probably not using it right&lt;/a&gt; nor &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/j4n0/status/1125380024733925377"&gt;properly&lt;/a&gt;. The CV tooling is neat, still I may just abandon it at some point and put the resume on here&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="task-list-item"&gt;&lt;input type="checkbox" disabled/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Gmail&lt;/strong&gt;: Contacts are exported and &lt;a href="https://oliz.io/blog/2022/personal-crm.html"&gt;migrated&lt;/a&gt;. Haven't actively reached out to anyone regarding the email change, yet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon&lt;/strong&gt;: In general, I prefer to buy in local or specialized (online) shops.
              Amazon still has the superior customer service and return/refund policy, so I may go with it for uncertain/risky purchases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kept using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GitHub&lt;/strong&gt;: Everything is static, in Git, under my domain and their fallback domain &lt;a href="https://ooz.github.io"&gt;https://ooz.github.io&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Migration&lt;/em&gt; to any other service is &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt; if desired at all&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;circleci&lt;/strong&gt;: No problem with that company at all, so far. Great FREE plan to offload some computing tasks like building this blog and observing the &lt;a href="https://oliz.io/zeitgeist/"&gt;Zeitgeist&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google / Android&lt;/strong&gt;: It's still unparalleled for advanced users. Smartphone usage is mostly work-related :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dropbox&lt;/strong&gt;: Still using due to convenience, &lt;a href="https://www.grepular.com/Protecting_Your_GNU_Linux_System_from_Dropbox"&gt;here is a guide to isolate the process&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://privacyguides.org/software/file-sharing/#sync"&gt;an alternative&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://vscodium.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VSCodium&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: VSCode without tracking, plus &lt;a href="https://github.com/ooz/olli/blob/master/.vimrc"&gt;&lt;code&gt;vim&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of course&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Educate others:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup your own domain and &lt;a href="https://sneak.berlin/20201029/stop-emailing-like-a-rube/"&gt;use it for email&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look for alternatives, e.g. on &lt;del&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.privacytools.io"&gt;https://www.privacytools.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/del&gt;, &lt;a href="https://privacyguides.org"&gt;https://privacyguides.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twitter&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="task-list"&gt;
&lt;li class="task-list-item"&gt;&lt;input type="checkbox" disabled checked/&gt; Not using it anymore&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="task-list-item"&gt;&lt;input type="checkbox" disabled checked/&gt; Add RSS feed generation to ggpy to make it easier for others to subscribe to my content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="task-list-item"&gt;&lt;input type="checkbox" disabled/&gt; WIP: Migrating my content to this blog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="task-list-item"&gt;&lt;input type="checkbox" disabled/&gt; I still need a solution to follow some people I know or like&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="further-inspiration-and-links"&gt;Further Inspiration and Links&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly, I'm not the first to be alienated. &lt;a href="https://oliz.io/links.html"&gt;So here are a bunch of other nice, informative websites/blogs by people following the same idea of an independent internet&lt;/a&gt;. Even more resources and tools:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mastering the Keyboard, the Mouse and Any Input Method or Tool, Really</title>
      <link>https://oliz.io/blog/2022/mastering-the-keyboard/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 16 Mar 2022 09:13:03 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://oliz.io/blog/2022/mastering-the-keyboard/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://oliz.io/blog/2022/on-mastery.html"&gt;As you may have read, I recently wrote about mastery.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a lifelong keyboard warrior, I have always appreciated the efficiency, precision and direct access of one of my best tools: The Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, today we are talking about that. Yeah, yeah, of course, I use a mouse, too. But that's a different topic for someone else, really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-keys"&gt;The Keys&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Images go long way, they say. I'm not a good photographer by any means, but I sincerely hope, you get the message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Some input methods, some of which I claim to own" src="TOOLS.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="my-reading-of-the-keys-and-the-map"&gt;My Reading of The Keys and The Map&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ESC     The escape or exit key
123     Important number keys: I, US, ALL
^Â°      Instructions for number keys, lots of space still
4       Bad luck number, right after important ONES
5%      Sounds like someone else's rule
6&amp;amp;      SIX AND (SIX AND (SIX)), oops, slipped a bit there
7/{     SEVEN, cut, EMBRACE
8([     Infinity, protect and TRUE STRIKE
9)]     Opposite of SIX, detach, IMMOVABLE WALL
0=}     DAMPFLÃ–CK smiley face with diving googles
ÃŸ?\     some German thing? More work I guess
Â´`      A roof
'Bksp'  Corrects errors if you TYPE TOO FAST
ENTER   NEWLINE, sends the message of GOD
Ã¼Ã¶Ã¤     or other regionals, for regional proof
TAB     Close to instructions, for aiming
GODKEY  Speak in the TRUE VOICE OF GOD; RTFM first
Shift   Temp. god speak, may be mistaken at times
&amp;lt;|&amp;gt;     Looks like some fighter space ship
CTRL    YOU JUST NEED TO TAKE IT, but easy friends
ALT     Another modifier, when CTRL doesn't work
SUPER   or windows or apple key, more WÃ–RK
SPACE   Easy to hit, important and big KEY
,;      joining words, thoughts
.:      joining sentences, highlighting NEXT
-_      partially forgotten SAD FACE, for quitters!
HASH    number sign, high command
+~*     stay positive, vibe, SEE THE LIGHT
ins, del, home, pg up etc., just some words
F1-F12  Function keys, for potions, assign at WILL&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</description>

      <title>How I always got what I wanted in Life</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a child I saw Star Wars Ep1 in the cinema.
I was already a Star Warsâ„¢ Fan before, since I watched it with my brothers (or/and father?) before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched the movie multiple times, since the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRmRGP9hzy8"&gt;pod race was my favourite scene&lt;/a&gt;.
The sound design, the racers crashing into the sand, the experience in the cinema, the ad-hoc engineering performed by Ani in his pod to survive the race. Just an overall AWEsome experience!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was briefly in the military after school (required service in the German air force).
Basic training was in Goslar, but the last six months we served in Laage (around G8 summit in 2007).
Due to performing good work on scrubbing Eurofighters, me and a friend were allowed to take part in an engine test run by our superior Staff Sergeant. While the friend and I targeted a military officer career, the Staff Sergeant lamented that he always regretted not studying. Luckily, I didn't stay in the military, didn't kill a real person, studied hard and met my girlfriend at work instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="engine-test-run"&gt;Engine test run&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The engine test run was just "like" podracing in the movie, except I got the rear seat and the mechanic colleague sat in the front seat and controlled the machine.
He turned the engine up and down and I could feel (from memory now):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hard time breathing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hot, sticky air, I used the pilot helmet+mask to blow fresh air into my face&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2x Hell boxed in steel, just a few meters behind me reminding just how AWEsome jet engines are. A true engineering feat demonstrating the superiority of the human mind and body!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire experience was the closest I ever got to "real" podracing and "real" engineering. But at least I'm a Software Engineer, now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="other-movies"&gt;Other movies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also saw "The Lion King" with my step mom, which is still a great movie to watch with children! But that's enough for a separate post...&lt;/p&gt;</description>
