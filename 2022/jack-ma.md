I didn't record the source of the following in my notes, but it was probably some Youtube video or article on [Jack Ma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Ma):

* Till 25: learn, do mistakes, be a good student
* Till 30: Follow someone, learn from them
* Till 40: Work for yourself
* Till 50: Do the things you are good at
* Till 60: Work for the young people
* Over 60: Spend time for yourself

## On Business

Focus on company culture! Focus on, in order:

1. Customers
2. Employees (often overlooked)
3. Investors

* Have a good (personal, company) name! Reputation is key!
* Follow Larry Page's "Toothbrush Rule": People should want to use a product/service worth billions at least twice a day!
