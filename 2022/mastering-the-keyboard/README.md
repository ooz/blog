## Greetings Everyone!

Hello everyone,

As you may have read, I think, I have recently attained mastery.

As a lifelong keyboard warrior, I have always appreciated the efficiency, precision and direct access of one of my best tools: The Keyboard.

So, today we are talking about that. Yeah, yeah, of course, I use my mouse, too. But that's a different topic for someone else, really.

## The Keys
