## Meditation Exercise

Sit comfortably, breathe (can close eyes), listen, try to identify 5 different sounds, then concentrate on your body, try to identify 5 feelings (pain, itches), try to listen again, 3 different sounds, then 3 feelings, then 1 sound, 1 feeling. At the end: breathe deeply multiple times, in-and-out.

Is also fun to do with a partner!

## The Damage Descartes Has Done

> There is a Zulu phrase, "Umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu", which means "A person is a person through other persons." This is a richer and better account, I think, than "I think, therefore I am." - https://aeon.co/ideas/descartes-was-wrong-a-person-is-a-person-through-other-persons

## "Before you can be with others, first learn to be alone"

> *"In the morning, â€“ solitude; â€¦ that nature may speak to the imagination, as she does never in company."* - Pythagoras

* Ask the Socratic question: *"What do you mean when you say ...?"*

## "Quitting Economy", "Me, Inc."

> Over time, a whole body of literature emerged advocating that people should view themselves as a business â€“ a bundle of skills, assets, qualities, experiences and relationships to be managed and continually enhanced.

> Your job might be a space to learn skills that you can use in the future. Or, it might be a job with a company that has a good-enough reputation that other companies are keen to hire away its employees. On the other hand, it isnâ€™t as good a job if everything you learn there is too specific to that company, if you arenâ€™t learning easily transferrable skills. It isnâ€™t a good job if it enmeshes you in local regulatory schemes and keeps you tied to a particular location. And it isnâ€™t a good job if you have to work such long hours that you never have time to look for the next job. In short, a job becomes a good job if it will lead to another job, likely with another company or organisation. You start choosing a job for how good it will be for you to quit it.

> In the quitting economy, you have to work for passion, and working for passion means focusing on the task, not the company.

## We Are All Unequal

> *"We are all unequal. No one, thank heavens, is like anyone else [...]*
> *We believe that everyone has the right to be unequal but to us every human being is equally important."* - Margaret Thatcher

## What Else and on Forgetting Things

I also recently started publishing my currently-still-WIP ["Axioms"](https://oliz.io/axioms/), which will be my main philosophical writing outlet.

[Why do we forget?](https://www.thriveglobal.com/stories/10396-neuroscience-says-there-s-a-huge-upside-to-being-forgetful
)

Every event, every example is singular.
Forgetting details is a way of generalizing and applying past memories, past examples to current situations.
Those abstractions are then used to explain the present, predict the future.
Sometimes the abstractions are wrong because a relevant detail has been left out.
Then we need a new abstraction, a new model.
