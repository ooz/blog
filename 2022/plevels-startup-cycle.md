[P. Levels](https://levels.io/) pretty famous indie maker and [digital nomad](https://nomadlist.com/).

His startup cycle:

1. Idea
2. Build it!
3. Launch it!
4. Grow it!
5. Monetize!
6. Automate!
7. Exit!

His predictions:

* Marriage is disappearing
* Relationship churn is fast
* Home ownership is disappearing
* People will travel more
* Different family units
* The collective existential crisis due to automation
* We have remote now, we want async

What hit home most for me:
He adviced on building solutions to one's own problems. Then grow organically, e.g. by using the above formula.
**If others built solutions to all your problems already, you are likely boring and your life just isn't very original!**
Uff!
