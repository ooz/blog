I always found "X years experience in Y" or "working with Z since year ABCD" or "EFG certified" not indicative of a person's skill whatsoever.
Nevertheless, we still need to keep this style around for automated application screenings based on keywords and numbers.

## Skill Matrix

Instead, I propose to grade skill level on further dimensions:

* Currently actively **learning** (solo/team/course)
* **Productivity**, can you create value using this? (guided/solo/team)
* **Mentoring** capability. Maybe explain this further, e.g. how this happens in your team, via code reviews, one-on-one mentoring etc.

E.g. for programming languages:

|Skill|Years Exp.|Certification|Learning|Productivity|Mentoring|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Python|13|-|solo|solo|FOSS work|
|Java|14|OCP Java 11|team|team|via code reviews, FOSS work|
|JavaScript|5|-|solo|guided| - |

For tools, natural languages and other qualifications similar tables could be made.

Also, one should probably list, what one is *not interested at all in* and what one want to *learn in the future* (learning backlog).
