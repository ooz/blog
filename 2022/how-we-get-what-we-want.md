As a child I saw Star Wars Ep1 in the cinema.
I was already a Star Warsâ„¢ Fan before, since I watched it with my brothers (or/and father?) before.

I watched the movie multiple times, since the [pod race was my favourite scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRmRGP9hzy8).
The sound design, the racers crashing into the sand, the experience in the cinema, the ad-hoc engineering performed by Ani in his pod to survive the race. Just an overall AWESOME experience (esp. for children not having seen Ben-Hur)!

I was briefly in the military after school (required service in the German Air Force).
After basic training (first three out of nine months), the Captain (C) asked me regarding further deployment.
The conversation went like this:

```
C: WHY ARE YOU HERE?

Me (baffled): Errm, mandatory military service I guess?

C: OKAY, LET ME REPHRASE: WHAT DO YOU WANT?

Me (still baffled): I like computers and jet planes, that's why I'm here!?

C: OKAY, MECHANIC ASSISTANCE AT MILITARY AIRPORT IT IS!
```

So, by basically saying what I like/wanted, I got to work with Eurofighter mechanics (after getting security clearance etc.)
NICE!
Due to performing good work on scrubbing Eurofighters, me and a friend were allowed to take part in an engine test run by our superior Staff Sergeant.
While the friend and I targeted a military officer career, the Staff Sergeant lamented that he always regretted not studying.
Luckily, I didn't stay in the military, didn't kill anyone and studied Computer Science instead.

## Engine Test Run

The engine test run was just "like" podracing in the movie, except I got the rear seat and the mechanic colleague sat in the front seat and controlled the machine.
He turned the engine up and down and I could feel (from memory now):

* Hard time breathing
* Hot, sticky air, I used the pilot helmet+mask to blow fresh air into my face
* 2x Hell boxed in steel, just a few meters behind me reminding just how AWEsome jet engines are. A true engineering feat demonstrating the superiority of the human mind and body!

The entire experience was the closest I ever got to "real" podracing and "real" engineering. But at least I'm a Software Engineer, now!
