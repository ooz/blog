A Jedi master is teaching young Padawans an important lesson on the Force.
Towards the end, one bored and exhausted youngling challenges the master: "I don't get it, maybe I can learn it from a real Jedi master and just not from you!"
The master, smiling, asks back: "Why is that?"
The youngling points to the master's Padawan braid.
The master, still smiling: "Exactly, because of younglings like you, I kept wearing the braid: to remind us, that there is always something to learn about the Force, for Jedi masters and Padawans alike. Lesson's over."

May the 4th be with you!
