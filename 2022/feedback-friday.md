title: Feedback Friday

Twitter has the concept of "Follow Friday":

* Each Friday, remind yourself to follow a new person
* This appreciates the work of others, may extend your bubble and their reach

For Twitter and its users, this has the following effects:

* Users get Dopamine kicks from gaining followers
* Users engage more in the platform (spend more time there) by both posting more content and consuming more content

## Better Way

A little reminder, this stuff was already possible is still possible with "web 1.0": via websites and emails, for instance.

Thus, I propose "Feedback Friday":

* Each Friday, reach out to someone whose work you appreciate, who inspired you. Maybe give pointers if asked for
* Use the preferred channel of the person you are contacting (email?)
* Maybe only do so if they explicitly asked for it
* ...or you see, they could use a cheer-up!

## Ping!

Over the course of the last two weeks, I got appreciative emails from [jonathanwieben.com](https://jonathanwieben.com/) (a former colleague) and [ohio.araw.xyz](https://ohio.araw.xyz/) (someone from nearly the opposite of the planet, who has common interests). Thanks all!

Both motivated the heck out of me, to write more and get back to work!

## Action!

Talk is cheap, so the last two weeks...

- [x] Sent a mail to Joshua (https://falseknees.com/) pointing out that we implemented [one of his comics](https://falseknees.com/111.html) by accident with [Handshake game](https://oliz.io/handshake/). Checking and recognizing later comics, I noticed he's a quite famous person now. Not expecting a reply, the subject may have also been too "spammy". But I hope, if read, it puts a smile on his face!
- [x] Sent a ping to Melissa (https://gracefully-unsettled.com/, former colleague), who hasn't posted an update in a while, asking whether she's fine.

Go go!
